            <h1>     Alice was beginning to get very bored. She and her sister were sitting under the trees. Her sister was reading, but Alice had nothing to do. 
                <br>
                Once or twice she looked into her sister’s book, but it had no pictures or conversations in it.
                 </h1>
             <h2>And what is the use of a book,’ thought Alice, ‘without pictures or conversations?’
                
             </h2>
            <h3> She tried to think of something to do, but it was a hot day and she felt very sleepy and stupid.

            </h3>
            <h4>She was still sitting and thinking when suddenly a White  Rabbit with pink eyes ran past her.

            </h4>
            <h5> There was nothing really strange about seeing a  rabbit. 
                <br> And Alice was not very surprised when the Rabbit said, ‘Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!’ (Perhaps it was a little strange, Alice thought later, but at the time she was not surprised.)
            </h5>
            <h6>But then the Rabbit took a watch out of its pocket, looked at it, and hurried on. At once Alice jumped to her feet.

            </h6>
